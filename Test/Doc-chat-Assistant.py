# answering, we may need to clean a lot of data beofre sending it to the LLM's I need to write some specific preprocessing datastpes for us 
# to answer the questions based of the LLm's And  the process is kind of similar as to what we need to do in the previous two projects.
# SO right Now as I donot have the data with me I am going to just comment most of the code out but will focus on creating a history based chat bot for

# we will be making use of the DOC-CORE Only as of now to implement the chat assistant 

# Everything is implemented in the DCO-CORE file as we can't import the file for some unkown godknown error with vscode
